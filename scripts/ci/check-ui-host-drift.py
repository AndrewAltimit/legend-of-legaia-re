"""UI host-drift checker: does every shared screen reach BOTH hosts?

The engine ships two hosts for the same game UI:

* **native** - `legaia-engine play-window` (`crates/engine-shell`, wgpu via
  `crates/engine-render`),
* **web** - the browser play page (`crates/web-viewer`, WebGL + canvas via
  `site/play.html`).

`crates/engine-ui` is the wgpu-free leaf both hosts share: every screen's
geometry is a `pub fn ..._draws_for(...) -> Vec<TextDraw>` (or `SpriteDraw`)
builder there, and a host "has" a screen exactly when it calls that builder.
That makes the set of engine-ui draw builders a **machine-checkable feature
surface** - no hand-maintained list of screens to fall out of date.

The failure this catches: an engine wave adds a screen to engine-ui, wires it
into the native window, and the browser play page silently drifts a release
behind. Nothing about that is visible in a diff. Here it is a red CI run.

Classification per builder:

* used by both hosts              -> ok
* used by native, not by web      -> DRIFT (fail, unless waived)
* used by web, not by native      -> web-ahead (info only)
* used by neither                 -> ORPHAN (fail, unless waived)

Waivers live in `scripts/ci/ui-host-drift-waivers.toml`; each needs a reason.
They are validated in both directions, which is what keeps the file honest:

* a waiver naming a builder that no longer exists   -> fail (stale)
* a waiver for a builder now wired on both hosts    -> fail (close it out)
* a `web_missing` waiver whose builder is not
  actually native-only any more                     -> fail (wrong bucket)

So the waiver file cannot rot into a lie: it only compiles as long as it
describes the real state of the two hosts.

Usage:

    python3 scripts/ci/check-ui-host-drift.py            # check, exit 1 on drift
    python3 scripts/ci/check-ui-host-drift.py --quiet    # findings only
    python3 scripts/ci/check-ui-host-drift.py --list     # full surface table
