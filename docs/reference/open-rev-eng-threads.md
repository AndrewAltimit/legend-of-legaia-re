# Open reverse-engineering threads

The live reverse-engineering **questions** about Legaia's runtime: what is
settled, what remains, and what evidence would close each one. It is the short
page of a three-page register - most questions about the retail game are
answered, so the bulk of the register is the settled and falsified pages.

## What this page is for

Before starting a hunt, look for it here. If the question is not on this page,
it is probably already answered or already disproved - the two companion pages
below hold those, and checking them first is cheaper than re-deriving them.

| Page | Holds | Read it when |
|---|---|---|
| This page | Live hunts: `open`, `partial`, `mostly resolved` | You are picking up work, or want to know whether a question is still contested. |
| [`re-settled-threads.md`](re-settled-threads.md) | Answered questions, each carrying an evidence grade | You need the answer to something, or you are about to build on a claim and want to know how firmly it is pinned. |
| [`re-do-not-re-walk.md`](re-do-not-re-walk.md) | Falsified hypotheses, reasoning intact | A reading of the bytes looks obvious and you want to check nobody has already disproved it. |

A closed thread leaves this page: its answer moves to the settled register, and
a reading it disproved moves to the falsified register with its reasoning.
Nothing on any of the three pages counts ports, tests, or coverage. Captures
and disassembly dumps live in the linked docs and under `ghidra/scripts/funcs/`.

## What an evidence grade means

Every settled row carries one of four grades, naming what its own stated
evidence rests on:

| Grade | The row cites |
|---|---|
| `disassembly` | Instructions, addresses, opcode encodings, branch or store sequences. The strongest grade. |
| `capture` | A runtime capture, save state, probe, firehose, or disc-derived oracle. |
| `decompiled-C` | Ghidra's C output, a `FUN_x(...)` call signature, a Ghidra label or plate comment, or a claim about store order / store count / a boolean operator with no instruction behind it. |
| `inference` | Reasoning from surrounding facts, corpus absence, or analogy, with no direct evidence cited. |

`decompiled-C` marks a claim **nobody has confirmed against instructions** - not
a claim known to be wrong. The C is a rendering: dropped register arguments,
`||` printed as nested `if`s, reordered or omitted stores, and hand-written
Ghidra annotations read as fact have each put a wrong statement on these pages.
The catalogue of those rendering artifacts, which is also the grading rubric, is
[`ghidra.md` § decompiler artifacts](../tooling/ghidra.md#decompiler-artifacts-that-have-produced-false-claims).
When a `decompiled-C` row is load-bearing for something you are about to build,
re-derive it from the disassembly first.

## Status conventions

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **open** | Active hunt. A concrete next step exists; the row names it. |
| **partial** | The main result is pinned; a residual sub-question remains. |
| **mostly resolved** | The mechanism is pinned; one leg is unconfirmed. |

A row may qualify the status in parentheses - `partial (transcode closed)`,
`open (narrowed)` - naming how far it got.

## How a thread is laid out

Each area below holds a table of one-line rows: the question, its status, and
the evidence that would close it. An area with no live hunt says so and points
at the settled and falsified pages for that area. A thread whose write-up
outgrows a table cell keeps its one-liner in the table and links to a `###`
section after the table.

## Recently corrected

Readings a re-audit against the disassembly or a capture overturned. They are
listed here as well as in the registers, because a claim that was wrong once is
the cheapest place to look for a claim that is still wrong.

- **A save point opens the pause menu by itself.** Op `0x49`'s `-1` rows
  (sub-ops `1` and `0x0D`) are a scripted menu-button press: the enter half
  stores handler `7` before it reads the table, so the "the park simply
  stands until Start" reading was wrong, and so was the menu-teardown leaf
  said to clear the park - it has no reference on the disc. A capture at the
  `town01` save point pins the chain and its release; every one of the
  disc's save points had saved nothing in the port
  ([settled](re-settled-threads/field.md),
  [falsified](re-do-not-re-walk.md#menus--ui)).
- **A shipped move program does keep the camera yaw factor.** The census
  that said none does walked each program to its first `HALT`, and every
  ext `0x37` is a pool-headroom guard that jumps that `HALT`; `urudre1`
  stager record 14 writes `0x0080` behind one. The port had also read the
  guard's operand against a constant "pool full", so every guarded field
  effect halted ([settled](re-settled-threads/measurement-corpus.md),
  [falsified](re-do-not-re-walk.md#rendering--camera)).
- **The slot machine's `rand % 5` picks a payline, not a sub-row nudge.**
  The `* 0x10` is the row stride of a landing-line table; forced stops land
  on any of the five lines ([settled](re-settled-threads/battle.md),
  [falsified](re-do-not-re-walk.md#battle--arts--level-up)).
- **BGM sub-op 3 pauses and sub-op 4 re-attaches.** The field VM's op-`0x35`
  arm table at `0x801CEE00` gives 3 = set pause bit 1 + `FUN_80026740` and
  4 = clear it + `FUN_80026478`, which replays the sequence from its start;
  the port had routed them the other way round, silencing the score at every
  sub-op-4 site ([falsified](re-do-not-re-walk.md#audio--sound-driver)).
- **Sub-op 2 stops and rewinds; sub-op 3 is the key-off pause.** Nothing a
  script writes resumes a track mid-phrase
  ([settled](re-settled-threads/audio.md)).
- **The menu refusal after a Door of Light arrival on `map01` is bounded.**
  The arrival tile is the cave mouth's walk-on trigger, and the menu opens on
  the first press after its script closes
  ([settled](re-settled-threads/field.md)).
- **`FUN_801E0418` redraws the title's strips behind the Load window**, from
  the title TIM (PROT 0890) - not memory-card messages from an unknown page
  ([falsified](re-do-not-re-walk.md#menus--ui)).
- **Nearer terrain hides about 1% of the overworld fog, not a fifth**, and
  the ground's bucket key is `FUN_801F89B8`'s, not the mesh leaves'
  ([falsified](re-do-not-re-walk.md#rendering--camera)).
- **The Rim Elm ambush seats its monsters from row 8, not the origin**, and
  allows Run: the formation row's header byte is `0`
  ([settled](re-settled-threads/battle.md)).
- **A dialog picker slides in; it does not resize.** The odd pager states
  count 24 frame-step units from off screen, and input opens only at count 0,
  26 vsyncs after the press ([falsified](re-do-not-re-walk.md#menus--ui)).
- **Motion ops `0x37` / `0x41` are one compass walk**, not two translate ops,
  and map01's cave-mouth walk-out is `B7 F8 00 81`, not `A2 F8 01`
  ([falsified](re-do-not-re-walk.md#field--locomotion)).

## Measurement + tooling

One live hunt, and it is about the instruments rather than the game: a capture-graded
claim is only as good as the save state it was measured on.

| Thread | Status | What would close it |
|---|---|---|
| Which save-state library entries still hold a patched executable? | open (narrowed) - audited and tagged; the rest need human play | A state made on a patched disc keeps that build's `SCUS_942.54` in RAM forever. `patch_taint_audit.py` tags each state's `resident_patch` at the hook sites (`states`) and over the whole executable (`scan`), so a state tagged retail is retail outside the bytes the game writes. The S1..S5 anchors, `first_town_interactive` and `teien_field_run` are re-shot retail and every capture-graded claim stands ([taint](../tooling/pcsx-redux-automation.md#patched-disc-taint)). Re-shooting the `rikuroa_*`, `dolk2_market_noa`, `cort_evolved_*`, `minigame_*_pcsx`, `battle_gaza2_*` and mednafen `overworld_battle_bg_angle_*` states on an unpatched image closes it. |

## Adding a thread

A thread belongs here when:

1. There is something *specific* that would close it - a probe to run, a dump to read, a function to port. "Generally understand X better" is not closable; skip.
2. The next step is non-obvious from the code or git log. If `grep` would surface it, no row needed.
3. The detail lives elsewhere (a docs page, a disassembly dump). The row is the pointer, not the analysis.

When the thread closes, move its answer to the matching area of [`re-settled-threads.md`](re-settled-threads.md) with an evidence grade, move any reading it disproved to [`re-do-not-re-walk.md`](re-do-not-re-walk.md) with its reasoning, and delete the row here. Do not leave a "closed here" note behind: this page lists live hunts only.
