# Field free-movement locomotion

The player free-movement controller for normal towns, dungeons, and walkable field areas is **`FUN_801d01b0`** in the field overlay (`overlay_0897`). Each frame it reads the held pad, turns it into a camera-relative direction, advances the player actor's world position a fixed step per sub-frame with per-axis collision, and updates the player's facing angle. This is the general locomotion path — **not** the [tile-board grid mode](tile-board.md) (a puzzle / board minigame that happens to live in the same overlay).

`FUN_801d01b0` was pinned with a runtime write-watchpoint on the player position fields (`scripts/pcsx-redux/autorun_player_pos_watch.lua`): walking in a field scene fires write hits at the four `sh` stores `0x801D0684 / 06E4 / 0744 / 07B4` (player Z± / X±), all inside `FUN_801d01b0`. Static analysis alone never surfaced it because the writes are buried in a 1964-byte function and the field overlay only loads at runtime.

## Player actor fields used

The player actor pointer is the global `_DAT_8007c364`. Confirmed fields on the actor struct:

| Offset | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `+0x10` | flags; bit `0x80000` = movement disabled (encounter pending / cutscene), bit `0x1000000` = action/interact requested |
| `+0x14` | world X (`s16`) |
| `+0x16` | facing angle for the renderer (`s16`, set elsewhere) |
| `+0x18` | world Z (`s16`) |
| `+0x26` | heading (8-direction movement angle, set from the pad direction) |
| `+0x5c` | running/dash state counter (`> 0` switches the walk-animation select) |
| `+0x72` | per-actor speed multiplier (fixed-point, `>> 12`) |
| `+0x94` | encounter-record pointer (see [encounter format](../formats/encounter.md)) |
| `+0x98` | interaction-target actor pointer |

World coordinates are plain `s16` in 1-unit resolution; one collision tile is `0x80` (128) units (see below). The field camera derives its origin by negating these — see [`world-map.md`](world-map.md) and the camera notes in [`open-rev-eng-threads.md`](../reference/open-rev-eng-threads.md).

## Spawn position on scene entry

The player actor's spawn position is set by the per-scene initializer `FUN_801D6704` (MAIN_INIT), not by the locomotion controller. There are two cases, selected by the field-entry mode global `_DAT_8007b8b8`:

- **Cold entry (`_DAT_8007b8b8 == 0`).** The player actor is created at actor coords **`(0xA40, 0, 0xA40)`** — the centre of the camera's `0x20`-tile view window — via `func_0x80024c88(&local_68=…)`, which writes `actor+0x14 = sVar13 + 0xA40`, `actor+0x16 = 0`, `actor+0x18 = sVar14 + 0xA40`. On a cold entry the sub-tile terms `sVar13`/`sVar14` are zero, so the spawn is the fixed window centre. The camera itself is seeded onto the MAN anchor (`local_60`/`local_5e`, filled by `FUN_8003AEB0`), then the follow camera tracks the player. **Cold entry only ever happens for the New Game opening scene (`town01`, Rim Elm)** — every other scene change is a warp — so `(0xA40, 0xA40)` is effectively Vahn's authored opening spawn. Byte-checked walkable against town01's base collision grid.
- **Warp entry (`_DAT_8007b8b8 == 2`).** `sVar13`/`sVar14` carry the sub-tile offset of the saved transition coords `_DAT_80084568`/`_DAT_8008456C` (`saved & 0x7F` minus `0x40`), so the player lands at the destination door rather than the window centre.

Provenance: `ghidra/scripts/funcs/overlay_0897_801d6704.txt` (the `func_0x80024c88` call + the `_DAT_8007b8b8 == 2` sub-tile block), `ghidra/scripts/funcs/80024c88.txt` (sets `actor+0x14/16/18` from the arg vec). Engine mirror: `legaia_engine_core::world::FIELD_COLD_SPAWN_XZ`, applied in `SceneHost::enter_field_scene`.

## Per-frame flow

1. **Disabled gate.** If `player.flags & 0x80000` is set, skip all movement (an encounter is queued or a cutscene owns the player).
2. **Action button.** An edge-pad action bit (`_DAT_8007b874 & 4`, gated by `DAT_8007b6a8`) plays the confirm SFX `func_0x80035b50(0x20)` and raises `player.flags |= 0x1000000` (talk / examine), short-circuiting movement that frame.
3. **Direction decode.** `func_0x800467e8(&_DAT_8007b850)` rewrites the held pad in place into a *camera-relative* mask (so "screen up" maps to the correct world axis regardless of camera azimuth). `FUN_80046494(player)` reads that remapped mask (`gp+0x538`) and returns the movement direction in bits `& 0xf000`, resolving diagonals (`0x9000 / 0xc000 / 0x3000 / 0x6000`). The player heading `+0x26` is set to one of eight angle constants from the same mask.

   | mask bit (post-remap) | axis delta |
   |---|---|
   | `0x1000` | Z + |
   | `0x4000` | Z − |
   | `0x2000` | X + |
   | `0x8000` | X − |

   (Same bit→direction convention as the tile board, because both call `func_0x800467e8`.)
4. **Speed.** The frame's travel distance is

   ```text
   speed = ((base_step * player[+0x72]) >> 12) * DAT_1f800393
   ```

   where `base_step` is `8` walking (`5` / `0xc` / `0x18` in special states such as run / forced-walk), `player[+0x72]` is the per-actor multiplier, and `DAT_1f800393` is the per-frame delta scalar (frame-rate compensation). Modifiers:
   - **Terrain slow.** If the player's current collision tile has flag `0x4000` set and the scene control byte `_DAT_801c6ea4[+0x61] == 1`, `speed >>= 1` (half speed — mud / shallow water).
   - **Diagonal normalise.** Under camera mode 4 with both axes pressed, `speed -= speed >> 2` (×0.75).
5. **Step loop.** The function then loops, advancing **2 units per iteration** until `speed` units are consumed. Each iteration checks the candidate axis for collision and, only if clear, commits the step:

   ```text
   if (dir & 0x1000) and collide(player, scene, 2) == clear:  player.Z += 2;  dZ = +8
   else if (dir & 0x4000) and collide(player, scene, 0) == clear:  player.Z -= 2;  dZ = -8
   if (dir & 0x2000) and collide(player, scene, 3) == clear:  player.X += 2;  dX = +8
   else if (dir & 0x8000) and collide(player, scene, 1) == clear:  player.X -= 2;  dX = -8
   ```

   `collide` is `FUN_801cfe4c`; `dir`-codes are `0 = Z−, 1 = X−, 2 = Z+, 3 = X+`. The committed per-frame delta vector is stored at `_DAT_8007bde0` (X) / `_DAT_8007bde4` (Z) for the downstream transform-commit + camera follow. Step SFX is `func_0x80035b50(0x20)`; a fully-blocked move plays the bonk `func_0x80035bd0(0x23)`.

After movement, the same function runs an interaction probe (`FUN_801cf9f4`, a `0x20 × 0x20` box test against `player[+0x98]`) to detect adjacency to talk-able actors when the action button is pressed.

## Collision — `FUN_801cfe4c`

`FUN_801cfe4c(player, scene, dir)` returns `0` when the move is clear and `2` when a static wall blocks it (plus bits `1`/`4` contributed by the finer `FUN_801cfc40` actor/edge probe). It samples a **per-scene collision tile map** through the base pointer `_DAT_1f8003ec`:

- The walkability grid lives at `*(_DAT_1f8003ec) + 0x4000`.
- The player world position is converted to tile space by `(coord + bias) >> 6`, then the byte index is `(tileX / 2 & 0x7f) + ((tileZ) * 0x40 & 0x3f80)` — i.e. rows of `0x40` bytes, up to `0x80` rows.
- Each map **byte's high nibble holds 4 sub-cell walkability bits**: the tile is split into a 2×2 quadrant grid, and `byte >> 4 & quadrant_mask` selects the relevant quadrant (`quadrant_mask` ∈ `{1,2,4,8}` from `tileX&1`, `tileZ&1`). A set bit = wall.
- So one map byte covers a `0x80 × 0x80` (128×128) world tile, divided into four `64×64` sub-cells.
- Direction-specific probe offsets come from the tables `DAT_801f21b4` / `DAT_801f2214` (16-byte stride per direction); the function probes three nearby points so the player's footprint (not just its centre) is tested against walls.

The sibling sampler `FUN_801d5718` reads the same `*(_DAT_1f8003ec) + 0x4000` grid with the identical nibble-and-mask shape, confirming the map layout.

## Where the collision grid comes from

`_DAT_1f8003ec` is the base of the **per-scene field buffer** (a scratchpad-resident pointer at `0x1F8003EC`). Its sub-regions:

| Offset from base | Content | Filled by |
|---|---|---|
| `+0x0000` | object / actor records (0x20-byte stride; up to 512) | scene loader / field VM |
| `+0x4000` | **collision + floor grid** — 1 byte/tile, `0x80`-byte rows: **high nibble** = 4 sub-cell wall bits, **low nibble** = floor-elevation tier | **base**: the `+0x4000..+0x8000` region of the per-scene `.MAP` file (`FUN_8001f7c0`); **deltas**: field-VM `0x4C` opcode, outer-nibble 7 |
| `+0x8000` | **per-tile object/attribute map** — `u16`/tile, `0x80`-byte rows: low 9 bits = object-record index into the `+0x0000` table, high bits = per-tile flags (bit `0x400` = object footprint) | object placement at scene load; bit `0x400` ORed in by `FUN_8003aeb0` from field-pack records |
| `+0x12000` | field-pack region; `_DAT_8007b8d0 = base + 0x12800` | `FUN_8001f7c0` (scene asset loader) |

### Collision byte: walls + floor height

Each `+0x4000` byte packs two nibbles for its 128-unit tile:

- **High nibble — walls.** Four sub-cell wall bits (the `2×2` quadrant grid the collision check samples; see above).
- **Low nibble — floor-elevation tier.** A 4-bit index `0..15` into a 16-entry `short` height LUT at scratchpad `0x1f80035c` (`= 0x1f800314 + 0x48`). The object/actor spawn iterator `FUN_8003a55c` reads `LUT[byte & 0xf]` and adds it to each placed object's Y, so a tile's collision byte also encodes its floor height (raised platforms, multi-level rooms). The LUT is filled at scene entry by `FUN_8003aeb0` from the MAN asset header (`_DAT_8007b898 + 2`, 16 negated `short`s).

The **base wall + floor data is an on-disc blob**: it is the `+0x4000..+0x8000` region of the per-scene field map file (`DATA\FIELD\<scene>.MAP`), streamed into the field buffer at scene load by `FUN_8001f7c0` (see the load chain under [Open](#open)). On top of that base, the field VM's `0x4C` (MENU_CTRL) opcode with outer-nibble 7 (`op0` ∈ `0x70..0x7F`, 7-byte op `[4C, 0x7s, b1, b2, b3, b4, mask]`) applies **story-conditional deltas** — a rectangular paint that sets/clears the high-nibble wall bits over a tile range (`col ∈ [b1, b3+1)`, `row ∈ [b2+1, b4+2)`; sub-op `s` = clear-walkable / block-all / clear-mask / set-mask), gated behind system-flag tests in the prescript. (An earlier reading claimed the nibble-7 paints were the *sole* wall source and there was no on-disc blob; that was a CPU-store-only static search that missed the DMA-streamed base — see [Open](#open).) The nibble-7 op is the same dispatch row in [`script-vm.md`](script-vm.md#0x4c-menu_ctrl---outer-nibble-dispatch).

The `+0x8000` map is **not** a terrain-flag grid (an earlier reading). It is a per-tile object/attribute word: its low 9 bits index the `+0x0000` object-record table, which `FUN_8003a55c` walks at scene entry to spawn the NPCs/objects occupying each tile. `FUN_8003aeb0` (the field/town scene-entry map-init — note its `town_mode` / `baria_mode` debug strings) ORs the `0x400` footprint flag into these cells from the field-pack region records (`+0x12000`, offset/count at `+0x12006` / `+0x12008`, 4-byte records).

### Object-record format (`+0x0000`, 0x20-byte stride)

`FUN_8003a55c` reads each record at `field_buffer + idx*0x20` (the `.MAP` file's authored
copy; the runtime region is mutated). Decoded fields:

| Offset | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `+0x00` | `i16` | X offset; `world_x = col*128 + this + 0x40` |
| `+0x02` | `i16` | Y offset added to the tile floor height (`heightLUT[grid_byte & 0xf]`) |
| `+0x04` | `i16` | Z offset; `world_z = row*128 - (this - 0x40)` |
| `+0x06` | `i8`  | footprint column delta to the anchor tile |
| `+0x07` | `i8`  | footprint row delta to the anchor tile |
| `+0x12` | `u16` | flags; bit `0x4` = placed/active, bit `0x800` ORs actor `+0x74` bit `0x10000000` |
| `+0x1e` | `u8`  | non-zero ORs actor `+0x74` bit `0x40000000` |

The anchor object is created by `FUN_80024c88(pos, …)` (writes `actor+0x14/16/18`), then
`FUN_8003a55c` writes `actor+0x60 = object_index` and copies record `+0x08/+0x0a/+0x0c`
into `actor+0x24/+0x26/+0x28`.

**This table is the static environment placement** — the visible terrain
segments, buildings, and props, *not* (only) NPC spawns. Each placed tile
allocates a static-object actor (shared tick fn `0x8003BC08`); the actor draws
its mesh from the [`scene_asset_table`](../formats/scene-bundles.md) TMD pack
through its `+0x44` mesh chain. (An earlier reading concluded this table held
"NPC / event / trigger spawns, not building meshes" from the near-zero
`+0x08..+0x0c` fields — that was wrong: those fields are not the mesh selector,
but the records *are* the buildings. Validated against a live `town01` save:
e.g. object id `137` = Vahn's house, anchor tile `(col 38, row 25)` ->
`world (4864, _, 3208)`, matching the live actor.) NPCs and event triggers ride
the same map via a sibling path (`FUN_8003a1e4`, partition-1 records, the
`0x7F,0x7F` parked-sentinel decode); the small actor pool note (about 8 slots,
`0xD8` stride, list heads `0x8007C34C..0x36C`, player `_DAT_8007c364`) refers to
that NPC/player set, while the static objects are a larger placed set.

Clean-room parser: [`legaia_asset::field_objects`](../../crates/asset/src/field_objects.rs)
(`parse_placements` + `pack_mesh_index` over the field map file); the engine
reads it via `Scene::field_object_placements`. Each object's drawn mesh comes
from the scene_asset_table TMD pack (byte-verified): `pack_index = obj_idx - 5`
for the field-actor band `93..=118`, otherwise the object record's `+0x10`
`u16` field; ids `1/2/3` are the protagonist/NPC meshes from the shared pool.
The `anim_id` resolved separately via the MAN script (`func_0x801d5630`) only
drives animation; it does not pick geometry. See
[`open-rev-eng-threads.md`](../reference/open-rev-eng-threads.md).

## Town / field parity

The controller is selected by **game mode**: mode `0x03` loads the field overlay (`overlay_0897`), which contains the single free-movement controller `FUN_801d01b0`. `FUN_801d01b0` was runtime-pinned on a walkable field scene (`map03`, mode `0x03`). Rim Elm — scene `town01` — also runs at game mode `0x03` (see `scripts/scenarios.toml`, the `v0_1_pre_battle_tetsu` anchor), so it loads the same overlay and the same controller. The shared scene-entry init `FUN_8003aeb0` corroborates this: it has an explicit `town_mode` debug-string branch and configures the same player actor (`_DAT_8007c364`: speed mult `+0x72 = 0x1000`, `+0x6a = 8`) for both towns and fields. So town locomotion is `FUN_801d01b0`, identical to the field.

## Engine port

The clean-room engine loads the base grid directly from the field map file. `SceneHost::enter_field_scene` resolves the `.MAP` entry via `Scene::field_map_index` — the unique CDNAME-block entry whose **extended on-disc footprint** is exactly `0x12000` bytes — and copies its `+0x4000..+0x8000` region into `World::field_collision_grid` (`World::load_field_collision_grid`). The grid byte format (high nibble = sub-cell wall bits, low nibble = floor-elevation tier) matches the runtime 1:1, so it copies verbatim; the field-VM `0x4C` nibble-7 hook then layers deltas on top as the prescript runs.

Footprint caveat: the TOC-**indexed** payload of the `.MAP` entry is only the first `0x4000` bytes (the object-record region); the collision grid and everything past it live in the entry's **trailing-gap sectors**, so the engine reads `ProtIndex::entry_bytes_extended`, not the indexed `SceneEntry::bytes`. Verified byte-exact: `town01`'s `entry10[0x4000..0x8000]` equals the live collision grid in a town01 save state (1297 wall tiles, zero diff). Disc-gated coverage: `crates/engine-core/tests/field_locomotion_disc.rs` (base grid non-empty on `town01` + `map03`, and the player stops at a real base wall).

### Environment geometry

A field/town scene's environment meshes (the terrain, buildings, and props) are Legaia TMDs packed inside **LZS streams of the scene_asset_table** PROT entry (`town01` = entry 4: 121 meshes, ≈8041 vertices). The clean-room `SceneResources` TMD pass scans each entry's LZS-decompressed sections in addition to its raw bytes (`tmd_scan::scan_entry`, the same path the TIM pass already used), so these meshes land in the scene TMD pool; the `scene_tmd_stream` skip still drops battle-character meshes in field mode. The field build uses `SceneLoadKind::Field` with `upload_all_tims`, matching retail's field loader (`FUN_8001f7c0`), which DMA-uploads every TIM — the environment meshes sample texture pages across the whole atlas, so a render-targeted upload drops most of their prims. Per-mesh **world placement** for this static geometry is the [Object-record table](#object-record-format-0x0000-0x20-byte-stride) above (`FUN_8003a55c`: the object-index grid at `+0x8000` of the field map file selects a `+0x0000` object record per placed tile, giving the mesh its world translation; `legaia_asset::field_objects` parses it, `Scene::field_object_placements` exposes it). Each object's mesh resolves to a scene-pack index (`pack_index = obj_idx - 5` for the field-actor band `93..=118`, else the record's `+0x10` field). Per-tile **world Y** = `-floorHeightLUT[tile_nibble] + y_off`, the LUT being 16 `s16` at the MAN header `+0x02` (`Scene::field_floor_height_lut`). `legaia-engine play-window` renders the town from this: `resolve_field_placement_draws` pairs each placement with its uploaded pack mesh + world transform (X/Z + floor-LUT Y) and draws them in `SceneMode::Field`.

### Scene-entry script

On entry the engine runs the scene's **scene-entry system script** (context channel `0xFB`), not event-script record 0. Record 0 of a per-scene event-script container is a trigger/dispatch table, not linear bytecode, so loading it as the field-VM buffer halts the VM at pc 0 and no entry logic runs. The retail per-frame driver `FUN_8003ab2c` builds the system script from the MAN asset's partition 1, first record; `Scene::field_man_entry_script` mirrors that resolve (`legaia_asset::man_section::ManFile::scene_entry_script` → `(start, pc0)`), and `SceneHost::enter_field_scene` loads the MAN slice from `start` with the VM PC at `pc0` (`World::load_field_script_at`). Slicing from the script start keeps the field VM's 16-bit-wrapping relative jumps anchored at the slice base, matching the retail `buffer_base = script_start`.

Every field/town scene carries its MAN in a [`scene_asset_table`](../formats/scene-bundles.md): kingdom-bundle scenes use the `count = 7` form, and the early standalone towns (`town01` = Rim Elm, `town0c`, …) use a `count = 6` form in their block's 2nd PROT entry (e.g. `town01` = entry 4, MAN at descriptor 1). `find_bundle` resolves both, so `field_man_entry_script` runs the real entry script for all of them. (An earlier reading held that standalone `SceneEventScripts` scenes "had no MAN in the static bundle" and fell back to event-script record 0; that was a detector gap - the `count = 6` table was rejected by a strict `count == 7 && first_offset == 0x40` check. The MAN source was pinned by a runtime write-watchpoint on `_DAT_8007B898` - the dispatcher `FUN_8001F05C` case 3 mallocs the buffer and LZS-decodes it from the table descriptor; see [`scene-bundles.md`](../formats/scene-bundles.md).) The base collision grid (loaded from the `.MAP` above) is independent of which entry script runs; the entry script's `0x4C` nibble-7 wall-paint deltas are gated behind system-flag tests and only fire once the world's story flags are seeded to a matching scene-entry state. Disc-gated coverage asserts the MAN-backed scenes' field VM advances past pc 0 (`town01`: 65, `map03`: 61 distinct PCs, settling into a per-frame loop).

#### Story-conditional wall deltas (map03)

Tracing `map03`'s entry script pins the gate flags directly: `TEST` flag `0x6C2` (at script offset `0x2c`) routes into a sub-1 "block all" paint over tile (col 66, row 102), and `TEST` flag `0x378` (at `0x4f`) routes into a contiguous three-paint cluster (sub-0 "clear walls" at offsets `0x56` / `0x5c` / `0x62`). At a fresh boot both flags are clear, so the entry script skips all four paints and the grid stays at its disc-loaded base — which is correct: these are story-conditional terrain changes, not the base walls. Seeding the matching system flags (in real gameplay, loading a save whose story-flag block has them set) makes the paints fire. The flag-bank base is `0x80085758` (= SC offset `0x1618`); see [`script-vm.md`](script-vm.md#0x4c-menu_ctrl---outer-nibble-dispatch). Disc-gated coverage: `crates/engine-core/tests/map03_conditional_walls_disc.rs` (with flag `0x6C2` seeded, the wall at tile (66, 102) appears; without it, it does not).

Reaching these paints exercised — and corrected — two bugs in the engine's nibble-7 paint that were latent while record 0 halted the VM: the paint's **row** range is `[row0+1, row1+2)` (the engine had `[row0, row1+1)`, one row too far north), and sub-0/1 paints are **6-byte** ops with no mask byte while sub-2/3 are 7-byte (the engine advanced every sub-op by 7, collapsing the three-paint cluster into one). Both match the retail handler at `0x801e1c64`.

### Scene encounter table

The same MAN that supplies the entry script also carries the scene's **random-encounter table** in its section 0 (`FUN_8003AEB0` installs it into the runtime control block `_DAT_801C6EA4 + 0x20`; see [`encounter.md`](../formats/encounter.md) and [`man-section`](../formats/scene-bundles.md)). Because the `count = 6` detector now resolves the standalone towns' MAN, the field scene-entry path can pull the disc-resident table for them too. `Scene::field_man_encounter_table` resolves the MAN through `find_bundle`, decodes the encounter section via `legaia_engine_core::encounter_man::scene_encounter_from_man`, and `SceneHost::enter_field_scene` installs it (`World::install_man_encounter`): the per-formation rows become `EncounterEntry`s keyed by row index, and the matching `FormationDef`s (row index → monster-id slots) are merged into the formation table so a triggered encounter resolves to a concrete monster set. The MAN carries formation monster-ids but not stat blocks, so the host installs the stat catalog separately; scenes whose bundle has no MAN keep the synthetic-pattern `EncounterRegistry` fallback.

This corrects a prior assumption that towns like Rim Elm (`town01`) had no random encounters: `town01`'s MAN encounter section declares **7 formations** at a low mean trigger rate (`6/256`), gated by its region records — the synthetic registry's "quiet town" entry was a guess that the disc data overrides. Disc-gated coverage: `crates/engine-core/tests/field_man_encounter_disc.rs` (boots `town01` / `town0c` / `map03`, asserts each installs a MAN encounter session whose row-index `formation_id`s all resolve to merged formation defs).

### Per-step encounter roll in the live loop

When `World::live_gameplay_loop` is set, locomotion feeds the encounter system directly: `World::live_field_tick` treats the player crossing into a new 128-unit collision tile (`pos >> 7`) as one *step* and drives a single `World::on_field_step` roll, mirroring the retail per-step counter rather than rolling every frame. A successful roll transitions `Field → Battle`; on victory the field actor table is restored and the player resumes where they stood. See the [live gameplay loop](battle.md#live-gameplay-loop--field--battle-in-tick) section in `battle.md` for the full round trip.

## Open

- **The base collision grid is streamed from disc; nibble-7 ops are conditional deltas on top.** A runtime Write-watchpoint on the live grid region (`_DAT_1f8003ec + 0x4000`) during a Drake-Castle → Drake-world-map transition caught exactly one writer: the CD-DMA channel-3 read primitive **`FUN_8005D9A0`** (the DMA store at `0x8005DA50`), reached via the thin wrapper `FUN_8005C2C4` from the per-sector streaming poller **`FUN_8003EF14`** (return site `0x8003EF68`). `FUN_8003EF14` DMAs one CD sector per ready-IRQ — `FUN_8005C2C4(*(gp + 0x940), 0x200)`: `gp + 0x940` (= `0x8007BC58`) is the destination cursor (it had `_DAT_1f8003ec + 0x4000`, the grid base), `0x200` is the DMA word-count (one 2048-byte sector), then the cursor advances `0x800` and the remaining-sector count at `gp + 0x968` decrements. So the field buffer — collision grid (`+0x4000`), object map (`+0x8000`), field-pack (`+0x12000`) — is the **leading region of a multi-sector streaming CD read** issued at scene load. The grid jumped from 2093 to 6805 wall tiles across the transition while only **6** nibble-7 tile-writes fired — proof the bulk arrives as disc sectors, not from script paints. The field-VM `0x4C` nibble-7 ops (`| 0xf0`, `& ~(mask<<4)`, `| mask<<4`, `& 0xf` at `_DAT_1f8003ec + col + row*0x80 + 0x4000` — the sole *CPU-store* writer) are conditional modifications layered on afterward.
  - *Two earlier readings were wrong, corrected here:* (a) a static draft claimed nibble-7 was the only writer and the base was script-authored — that came from a CPU-store search that can't see the DMA path; (b) a first pass at this capture misread the DMA args as a single `0x10200`-byte block at LBA `0x20943`. In fact the BP fired *after* `FUN_8005D9A0` does `a1 |= 0x10000`, so the real size arg is `0x200` (one sector), and `0x20943` is a hardcoded constant inside the DMA primitive, not a per-scene LBA. `FUN_8005D9A0` takes `(dest, mode)` — see [`boot.md`](boot.md) for the CD-read API.
- **For the engine, base collision is a load step, not a script step**: the collision grid is the `+0x4000…+0x8000` region of the per-scene **main field file** — `DATA\FIELD\<scene>.MAP` by ISO9660 name in retail, or the field record's PROT entry in the debug path. Load that file and slice bytes `0x4000..0x8000`; no script execution is needed for the base walls. The nibble-7 ops still matter for story-conditional changes — they ride the scene's field-VM scripts, which run multi-context at load: the same transition fired `FUN_8003aeb0` (scene-entry init) → `FUN_8003ab2c` (MAN system-script prologue runner) and 17 distinct script contexts (two `0xFB` system channels + per-actor `0x06..0x14`), and the 6 nibble-7 paints came from the `0xFB` system context via `FUN_8003ab2c` — validating that path as the conditional-delta painter.
- **Field-buffer load chain (resolved end-to-end).** The per-scene field-asset loader `FUN_8001f7c0(dest, scene_name, field_record)` fills the field buffer at `dest` (the `_DAT_1f8003ec` base): the leading region (collision `+0x4000`, object map `+0x8000`) is the main `.MAP` file; the field-pack `+0x12000` and `efect.dat` `+0x12800` come from separate files. Two transports converge on shared streaming machinery:
  - *Retail*: builds `DATA\FIELD\<scene>.MAP`, opens it by ISO9660 name (`FUN_800608f0`), streams into `dest` via `FUN_8003e6bc`. The disc LBA is the ISO9660 directory entry.
  - *Debug* (`_DAT_8007b8c2 != 0`): `FUN_8003e8a8(field_record, 1)` sets the `CdlLOC` at `0x8007bc5c` from the in-RAM PROT TOC (`0x801C70F0`): `target_sector = CdPosToInt(base_loc@0x8007bc50) + toc[field_record + 2]` (the documented `start_lba = toc[p+2]`); then `FUN_8003e800(dest, 0x28, 1)` issues a 40-sector (`0x14000`-byte) streaming read.
  - Shared core: `FUN_8003e800(dest, count, flags)` (generic read entry; sets `gp+0x894`/`gp+0x97c`) → `FUN_8003f128` (arm: copies dest/count into `gp+0x940`/`gp+0x968`, seeds `gp+0x8c8` from the current CD position, issues `CdControl(CdlSetloc=2, &cdloc@0x8007bc5c)`, registers the data-ready callback) → `FUN_8003EF14` per-sector poller → `FUN_8005C2C4` → `FUN_8005D9A0` CD-DMA primitive (one sector per ready-IRQ, dest cursor `+= 0x800`). This is the same `FUN_8005D9A0` writer caught by the runtime watchpoint above — static loader trace and watchpoint agree.
  - The same generic entry serves other clients (`FUN_8003e104` = the `h:\mpack\monster_snd` pack loader), confirming `FUN_8003e800`/`FUN_8003f128` are shared streaming infrastructure, not field-specific. (This corrects an earlier note that ruled `FUN_8001f7c0` out as "loads `+0x12000`/`+0x12800` only" — it loads the base `.MAP` too, which *contains* the `+0x4000` grid.)
- `FUN_801cfc40` (the finer actor/edge collision probe contributing bits `1`/`4`) is not fully decoded.
